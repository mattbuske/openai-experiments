## Overall Story Constraints
You are free to create whatever story you want as long as it fits within the defined constraints.
The genre of each story is science fiction with elements of cosmic horror and psychological thriller.
The conclusion in the outline counts as a chapter and should be titled 'Epilouge'
Each story is centered around the same event, but each story contains it's own unique perspective of the event to create an anthology of 'interlinked' tales.
All the stories are happening simultaneously.
Each tale should be open ended in some way, and leave interpretation up to the reader.
It should not be clear as to if the protagonists were successful or not, that way when all stories are read, it is unclear which protagonist or if all of them were the potential reason the signal stops.

### Overall Plot
The plot centers around a mysterious signal coming from beneath the surface of the earth somewhere on the planet. 
It involves a nefarious ancient cult related to the signal.
The signal appears to be what starts the process that causes the cosmic events of each story.
When the signal stops- it coincides with a black out that happens in the climax of the last tale and should be included in some way in each story to tie them together.
